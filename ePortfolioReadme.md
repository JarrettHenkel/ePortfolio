# Professional Self-Assessment

## Coursework and Program Experience

Throughout my Computer Science program, I've engaged in diverse coursework that has been instrumental in shaping my skills and professional goals. The artifacts in my ePortfolio serve as tangible evidence of my journey and proficiency in key areas:

- **Collaboration and Databases:** Working on projects like the Advanced Java Calculator and the MongoDB Dash Application has honed my ability to collaborate effectively in team environments. In both artifacts, I've shown competancy in the creation of tools that will help benefit collaboration through the management and creation of databases. Through the use of Git, code reviews, and knowledge of agile processes, has prepped me for functioning as a team when I start.
  
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** The implementation of a Binary Search Tree in the Java Calculator project and the efficient database operations in the MongoDB Dash Application underscore my mastery of fundamental data structures and algorithms. These experiences have equipped me to tackle complex computational problems and optimize solutions for efficiency and scalability, something that will continue to be extremely important as in my coming career.
  
- **Software Engineering and Security:** In multiple projects I'm demonstrated modular and safe/secure code, I've cultivated a strong foundation in software engineering principles and security best practices. These skills are indispensable in developing robust, reliable, and secure software systems, aligning with industry standards and expectations.

## Professional Growth and Values

My journey through the Computer Science program has not only enhanced my technical aptitude but also instilled in me core professional values such as adaptability, continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence. The challenges I've encountered, such as optimizing performance in real-time graphics rendering for the 3D Modeling project, have reinforced the importance of perseverance and creative problem-solving in overcoming obstacles.

## Preparation for Employment/The Future

I actually officially started my first software engineering job two weeks ago. I'll be working in the defense sector which has led to some rather interesting questions already. I'm actually moving everything to private on github as soon as I graduate, along with most social media. Security advised me that deleting all social media presence entirely short of LinkedIn is advisable going forwards, as while they aren't forbidden, watching what you say/post is extremely advisable until you learn more about what you can't say. Thus removing the possibility is recommended.

### Advanced Java Calculator Project

This repository hosts the Java implementation of an advanced calculator originally created in March 2023. It features a graphical user interface with robust input validation, supporting complex mathematical operations and data storage using a Binary Search Tree (BST). Future plans include extending its capabilities for more complex algebraic functions and improving the user interface for a better experience.

### 3D Modeling Project - Dynamic Orbits and Textures

This repository contains a 3D modeling project initially created in October 2024. It showcases dynamic functionality like rotation and orbit movements, along with real-time texture and lighting updates. Challenges included optimizing performance and implementing accurate orbital mechanics. Future enhancements aim to automate the build process and increase the complexity of the model.

### MongoDB Dash Application

This project is a comprehensive MongoDB-backed Dash application designed for managing animal data with interactive user interfaces. It leverages modular codebase principles for scalability and features enhanced security measures like hashed passwords. Challenges included the initial setup of MongoDB, which future updates aim to simplify. Future plans involve automating database setup and implementing continuous integration/deployment pipelines.
