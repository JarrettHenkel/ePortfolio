# 3D Modeling Project - Dynamic Orbits and Textures

This repository contains a 3D modeling project initially created in October 2024, which has been enhanced to include dynamic functionality such as rotation and orbit movements, along with real-time texture and lighting updates. This project was originally a static recreation of a photographed scene, transformed to incorporate dynamic elements to enhance my 3D modeling skills relevant to my career.

## Project Overview

The artifact showcases the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOO) principles and my ability to adapt algorithms to changing circumstances in a 3D context. This project serves as a practical application of 3D modeling concepts, which I will use in my professional work environment.

### Features

- **Dynamic Orbits**: Implementation of orbiting movements where various objects rotate around each other.
- **Texture and Lighting Updates**: Real-time updates to textures and lighting calculations based on object positions relative to the light source.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Introduction of interactive elements such as adjustable perspectives and object movements.

### Technical Stack

- **OpenGL/GLFW**: Used for rendering 3D graphics.
- **GLM**: Utilized for matrix and vector operations.
- **STB Image**: Employed for texture loading.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Optimization**: Initially faced performance issues due to high-resolution textures, which required optimization techniques such as texture resizing.
- **Orbit Implementation**: Encountered difficulties with getting the orbital movements correct, necessitating several rewrites of the rendering logic.
- **Lighting Simplicity**: Anticipated challenges with dynamic lighting were mitigated once the orbital mechanics were correctly implemented.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Build Process**: Implement a script to automate the compilation and setup process.
- **Extending Complexity**: With most of the functionality set up, I intend to eventually convert the model into that of the solar system.

## Conclusion

This project not only refined my technical skills in 3D modeling but also emphasized the importance of performance optimization in real-time graphics rendering. The ability to dynamically update and manipulate 3D scenes has prepared me well for upcoming challenges in my career.
